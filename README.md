# Music-Generation-using-genetic-Algorithm-and-Neural-Networks
This project explores the generation of music using a combination of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Neural Networks (NN). The aim is to create a system that can generate novel music compositions by evolving a population of musical sequences over several generations and training a neural network to evaluate and improve the compositions.

## Introduction

Music generation has long been an area of interest in both artificial intelligence and creative computing. In this project, a hybrid model combining **Genetic Algorithms** and **Neural Networks** is used to generate original music compositions. The Genetic Algorithm is used to evolve musical sequences, while Neural Networks are used for fitness evaluation, guiding the evolution process towards more musically pleasing outputs.

## How It Works

1. **Genetic Algorithm**: The algorithm starts with a randomly generated population of musical sequences (e.g., a list of MIDI notes or piano roll representations). These sequences undergo selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve over time.
   
2. **Neural Networks**: A neural network is trained to predict the "fitness" of each sequence based on a set of musical features such as melody, harmony, rhythm, and structure. This neural network helps guide the genetic algorithm toward more sophisticated and pleasant compositions.

3. **Evolution Process**: Over several generations, the genetic algorithm evolves the music sequences by selecting the best-performing ones, crossing them over, and introducing small random changes to discover new and better compositions.

4. **Music Generation**: After several generations, the final evolved sequences are transformed into music using MIDI or other sound synthesis methods.
